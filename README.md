A collection of algorithms for pose estimation from points and lines in 2/3 views.
List of algorithms:
  1. Trifocal tensor computation from matched points in 3 views. Atleast 7 points correspondences are needed.
  2. Camera pose estimation from the minimum 3 3D-2D lines correspondences from the papers: 
    a. "Pose Determination from Line-to-Plane Correspondences: Existance Condition and Closed Form Solutions"
    b. "Pose Estimation from Line Correspondences: A Complete Analysis and A Series of Solutions"
   
Dependencies:
  Eigen linear algebra library
